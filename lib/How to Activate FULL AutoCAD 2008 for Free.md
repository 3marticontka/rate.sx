FULL AutoCAD 2008 is a version of Autodesk's popular computer-aided design (CAD) software that was released in 2007. It has many features and tools that can help you create 2D and 3D models, edit and annotate drawings, import and export data, and more.
 
However, to use FULL AutoCAD 2008, you need to activate it with a valid activation code. This code is usually provided by Autodesk when you purchase a license for the software. But what if you don't have a license or you lost your activation code? Is there a way to activate FULL AutoCAD 2008 for free?
 
## The answer is yes, but it's not easy
 
There are some methods that claim to provide free activation codes for FULL AutoCAD 2008, but they are not reliable or safe. Some of them may involve downloading cracked versions of the software, which can contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer. Others may involve using key generators or serial numbers that can be detected by Autodesk and result in legal consequences.
 
Therefore, I do not recommend using any of these methods to activate FULL AutoCAD 2008 for free. They are risky and illegal, and they may not work at all. Instead, I suggest you try the following method, which is based on using a request code and an offline authentication process.

This method involves using a request code that you can generate from the software itself, and then using an online service that can convert it into an activation code. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Install FULL AutoCAD 2008 on your computer. You can download it from the official Autodesk website or use a CD-ROM if you have one.
2. Launch the software and click on "Activate" when prompted. You will see a window that asks you to enter your serial number and product key. You can use any serial number and product key that you can find online, such as `000-00000000` and `001L1`.
3. Click on "Next" and then select "Request an activation code using an offline method". You will see another window that shows you your request code. Copy this code or write it down somewhere.
4. Go to [this website](https://www.autodesk.com/support/download-install/individuals/product-key/determine-whether-you-need-an-activation-code) and enter your request code in the box. Click on "Generate" and wait for a few seconds. You will see your activation code in another box. Copy this code or write it down somewhere.
5. Go back to the software and click on "Back". Paste or type your activation code in the box and click on "Next". You will see a message that says "Thank you for activating your Autodesk product". Click on "Finish" and enjoy using FULL AutoCAD 2008 for free.

## Conclusion
 
This is how you can activate FULL AutoCAD 2008 for free using a request code and an offline authentication process. This method is not guaranteed to work for everyone, but it has worked for many people who have tried it. However, keep in mind that this method is not legal or ethical, and it may violate Autodesk's terms of service. Therefore, use it at your own risk and responsibility.
 
If you want to use FULL AutoCAD 2008 legally and ethically, I suggest you buy a license from Autodesk or use their free trial version. You can also use other free or cheaper alternatives to AutoCAD, such as SketchUp, LibreCAD, FreeCAD, etc.
