## Examples

- If you want to create a smooth and seamless transition between two scenes, you can use the Impact Dissolve transition. This transition blends the clips together with a soft dissolve that preserves the details and colors of both clips.
- If you want to add some motion and energy to your video, you can use the Impact Push transition. This transition slides one clip out of the frame while pushing another clip in. You can choose the direction and speed of the push, and add some blur or distortion for more impact.
- If you want to spice up your video with some style and flair, you can use the Impact Flash transition. This transition creates a bright flash of light that reveals the next clip. You can adjust the color and intensity of the flash, and add some glow or bokeh for more sparkle.
